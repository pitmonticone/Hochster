\begin{proposition}
  Let $\textbf{A}$ and $\textbf{A'}$ be springs with indices $v$, $v'$
  respectively. Let $(f,h)$ be an indexed spring homomorphism from $\textbf{A}$
  to $\textbf{A'}$. If $(a,b)$ belongs to $G(\textfb{A'},v')$, then (h(a),h(b))
  belongs to $G(\textfb{A},v)$.
\end{proposition}
