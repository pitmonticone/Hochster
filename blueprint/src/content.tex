\begin{proposition}
  Let $\boldsymbol{A}$ and $\boldsymbol{A'}$ be springs with indices $v$ and $v'$
  respectively. Let $(f,h)$ be an indexed spring homomorphism from $\boldsymbol{A}$
  to $\boldsymbol{A'}$. If $(a,b)$ belongs to $G(\boldsymbol{A'},v')$, then
  (h(a),h(b)) belongs to $G(\boldsymbol{A},v)$.
